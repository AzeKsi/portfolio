              I am a self-taught, creative frontend developer, web designer and wanted to become full stack developer
              with UI/UX skills in the future based in Wroclaw, Poland. I'm passionate about catering to emerging
              startups and small businesses that make an impact, inspire and connect with people üòé.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5 text-2xl leading-9 text-gray-800">
              When I'm not developing or designing, I enjoy watching videos about front-end development, productivity
              and design. I also enjoy spending time with my cat üêà and distracting myself by going to the gym or riding
              my bike.
